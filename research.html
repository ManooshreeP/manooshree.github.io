        <p> In deploying Inclusive Study Groups, we discovered that a lack of communication 
            was one the largest barrier student groups faced. To alleviate this, 
        I created and taught a 1 unit P/NP course that complemented EECS 16A and successfully facilitated 
        group interactions.

    Underrepresented students in the fields of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science (EECS) can face greater difficulty in 
    finding student study groups than their more represented peers. Student study groups have many academic and socio-emotional benefits 
    and thus, we created a multi-partioning algorithm to create student study groups. Our solution is optional, systemic in that it 
    shifts the burden of finding study groups from the students onto the instructors, and avoids solo-status (no member of an underrepresented
    identity group will be the only member of their group). Sinec Fall 2020, we have deployed the system in 13 undergraduate classes at UC Berkeley and 
    matched over 4,200 students into groups.
