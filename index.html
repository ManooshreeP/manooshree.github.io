        <p>I'm a second year Science and Math Education 
            PhD student at UC Berkeley and am also pursuing an MS in Electrical Engineering and Computer Science. 
            I am advised by Dr. Dor  Abrahamson in the EDRL and by Dr. Gireeja Ranade in EECS.

        Before returning to school, I was an Engineering Program Manager at Apple in Health Sensing Technologies where I worked on Apple Watch features. 
        I completed my undergraduate degree from UC Berkeley in Bioengineering and was a student researcher in Dr. Moriel Vandsburger's cardiovascular imaging lab.  </p>
